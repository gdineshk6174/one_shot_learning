# one_shot_learning
one-shot classification (20-way)on 'Omniglot- dataset' using a siamese neural network

One-shot learning is an object categorization method where unlike traditional machine learning and deep learning methods where they use hundreds or thousands of samples/images and very large datasets, one-shot learning uses 'one or few samples/ images to categorize the images. Hence the name one-shot learning.

In this project i have applied 'Siamese neural network' and other simpler models on 'Omniglot dataset' to see how they perform..
